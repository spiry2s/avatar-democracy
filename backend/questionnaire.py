"""
The seeding questionnaire for an Avatar's political-compass profile.

This is step 1 of the hybrid configuration model: a short set of Likert-scale
statements that produce a multi-axis "compass". The citizen then refines this
with a free-text values statement and per-issue delegates (see profile.py).

The compass is deliberately multi-axis rather than a single left/right line,
because the Avatar votes per-issue and needs per-domain signal. The numbers are
a fallback the Avatar uses only when no delegate and no values statement covers
a given section.
